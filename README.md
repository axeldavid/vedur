Vedur.is
=========

This is a simple python interface to get weather information from the Icelandic met office [Veðurstofa Íslands](http://vedur.is).


Dependencies
-------------

On ubuntu 12.04 I needed to install the following dependencies before I could install the
python libraries from requirements.txt:
* python-dev
* libxml2-dev
* libxslt1-dev

Then just run:

	´pip install -r requirements.txt´

assuming you use pip. Otherwise just make sure the python libraries listed in requirements.txt
are installed.
